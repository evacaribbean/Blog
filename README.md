## Color and Size in Geometrics
 
This geometrics program is coded in one source file. Without zillions of classes though with many enought, it could have been good to divide them into a few more source files. But here I wanted to focus on constructors, public and not public classes, inheritance and overloading.

I create a task, saying:

<em>"Build a console program that changes the colors and sizes of its geometrical figures. Depending on each shape's area or volume."</em>      

<br>

<br>

The solution above consists of six classes. Where the main method entry point is unfolded.

I find it nice to have as little as possible written in the entry point. So I often start here, and work may way back into the classes and its members. In this way the overview will present itself first. And the code design naturally finding its way from overwiew to "details".


To try the console program out, just change the values in the instantiated objects.

<br>

(the [next article](https://github.com/evacaribbean/Blog#input-output) describes a console program where the user instead has the possibility to alter the values directly by console input)

<br>
<br>

### entry point

Starting with the overview, coding and "set up" the main method entry point. Now the code design easily forms and answers my questions on how the program should be written.

<br>

- Should the class have printlns?
- Should there be any direct values in the class?
- Should the class present just one method and constructor, or many?
- Should I use as few members as possible in the class?
- Should the program have few or many classes?
<br>

``` javascript
public class G {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Circle cir = new Circle(1, 21);	 
		Cube cub = new Cube(5, 18, 64);		 		
		Square squ = new Square(12, 4);		 	
		Triangle tri = new Triangle(2, 1);	 

		cir.info();		
	 	cir.cirColorInfo(); cub.cubColorInfo(); 
	 	squ.squColorInfo(); tri.triColorInfo(); 		
	}
} 
``` 
 
<br>
<br>

### inheritance (extends)  

The only thing in this program that extends from the superclass "Geometry", are the variables. To be used in each geometry subclass to avoid variable duplicates.

"Geometry" also has two void methods (without being used as "extensions"). The "main class" calls (invokes) the info() method. The other one doesn't do anything.

Plain and simple.

<br>

``` javascript
class Circle extends Geometry { ‚Ä¶ }
``` 

By calling the geometry class from the circle class. Asking to extend from geometry. Circle inherits all available varaibles and methods from geometry. In this context, geometry is a superclass and circle a subclass. Sometimes also refered to as parent and child classes. 

<br>

Viewing inheritance in its context of *interface*, *superclass*, *subclass*, *abstract class*, *overload* and *override* from a more overall perspective, the concept will be quite straightforward. Below a picture on this concept. 

<br>

![a logical perspective](/images/overallperspective.jpg)

<br>

First, any class ‚Äúimplements‚Äù from an interface. But a subclass‚Äúextends‚Äù (inherits) from an abstract class or a superclass (as well as ‚Äúimplements‚Äù).

**Now, looking at the picture‚Äôs** subclass: ‚ÄúBird‚Äù. It can inherit from the two abstract classes and the superclass. And if it wish to use the interface it does so by implementing it.

To narrow it done a bit. If the program is well written, there will be no logical reason why Bird should use the abstract class: ‚ÄúPlants‚Äù. And likewise, both the superclass and the abstract class will not repeat the members that already exist in the interface: ‚ÄúUnspecific‚Äù. Instread, the interface will be implemented.

**Checking the subclass:** ‚ÄúForest‚Äù instead. It will in the same manor inherit (‚Äúextend‚Äù) from its abstract class: ‚ÄúPlants‚Äù and its superclass: ‚ÄúBiology‚Äù. And finally. The interface's members should preferably be so common, that they can be used in every class. In this way these members don't have to be repeated in any other class in the program.  

<br>

Test for example: Ladybug, Frog, Bryophyte, Human and Berry.

## The Java Adventure

Real real gone - such great time! I first thought: "No matter what, uphill both ways, snow and snow again, dog slow ... on and on and on, my my...". 

But nop! It is with such delight I¬¥ve been reading books, enjoy Internet videos, teaching myself, and participate in Java courses. It is great! The subject seemed to be so fun. So interesting! Diving down, not sure if it'll be what I hoped for (even if it looked exciting). It soon turned out to be, just great time - Yeess! I was lucky. 

Then I knew, this is it. This is the subject.
