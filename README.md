## Color and Size in Geometrics
 
This geometrics program is coded in one source file. Without zillions of classes though with many enought, it could have been good to divide them into a few more source files. But here I wanted to focus on constructors, public and not public classes, inheritance (extends) and overloading.

I make up a task, saying:

<em>"Create a console program that changes the colors and sizes of its geometrical figures. Depending on each shape's area or volume."</em>      

<br>

<br>

The solution above consists of six classes. Where the *main method entry point* is unfolded.

I find it nice to have as little as possible written in the entry point. So I often start here, and work may way back into the classes and its members. In this way the overview automatically has to present itself first. And with this, the design which will give the answers on how to code also naturally makes it easy on how to continue. From overwiew to "details".

To try the console program out, just change the values in the instantiated objects.

### entry point

Starting with the overview, I've found it good to always begin coding and "set up" by the main method entry point. With this approach the code design easily forms and answers my questions on how the program should be written. 

<br>

- Should the class have printlns?
- Should there be any direct values in the class?
- Should the class present just one method and constructor, or many?
- Should I use as few members as possible in the class?
- Should the program have few or many classes?
<br>

``` javascript
public class G {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Circle cir = new Circle(1, 21);	 
		Cube cub = new Cube(5, 18, 64);		 		
		Square squ = new Square(12, 4);		 	
		Triangle tri = new Triangle(2, 1);	 

		cir.info();		
	 	cir.cirColorInfo(); cub.cubColorInfo(); 
	 	squ.squColorInfo(); tri.triColorInfo(); 		
	}
} 
```

## The Java Adventure

Real real gone - such great time! I first thought: "No matter what, uphill both ways, snow and snow again, dog slow ... on and on and on, my my...". 

But nop! It is with such delight IÂ´ve been reading books, enjoy Internet videos, teaching myself, and participate in Java courses. It is great! The subject seemed to be so fun. So interesting! Diving down, not sure if it'll be what I hoped for (even if it looked exciting). It soon turned out to be, just great time - Yeess! I was lucky. 

Then I knew, this is it. This is the subject.

( I just test now how font and images will look, I will come back later on. Maybe it'll take a while, but I'll be back ðŸ˜Š )
