## Color and Size in Geometrics
 
This geometrics program is coded in one source file. Without zillions of classes though with many enought, it could have been good to divide them into a few more source files. But here I wanted to focus on constructors, public and not public classes, inheritance (extends) and overloading.

I make up a task, saying:

<em>Create a program that changes the colors and sizes of its geometrical figures. Depending on each shape's area or volume.</em>

## The Java Adventure

Real real gone - such great time! I thought first: "No matter what, uphill both ways, snow and snow again, dog slow ... on and on and on, my my...". 

But nop! It is with such delight IÂ´ve been reading books, enjoy Internet videos, teaching myself, and participate in Java courses. It is great! The subject seemed to be so fun. So interesting! Diving down, not sure if it'll be what I hoped for (even if it looked exciting). It soon turned out to be, just great time - Yeess! I was lucky. 

Then I knew, this is it. This is the subject.
